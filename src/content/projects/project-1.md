a website to view Washington state legislature bills and events related to them. This makes it easier for those interested in the political process to keep track of those events. Made in collaboration with gknutson1[https://github.com/gknutson1] for a political science student. I worked mainly on the frontend while my partner worked mainly on the database.
Our tech stack used Django (Python), MariaDB, and Bootstrap.
