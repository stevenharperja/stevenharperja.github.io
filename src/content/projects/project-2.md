https://itch.io/jam/the-2024-escape-jam Submission to the Escape 2024 game jam. with A-Tanner
Along with:
Submissions for the Tri-Jam game jam. We did our best to make a game in only 3 hours. I learned a lot about how to use (and make mistakes with) git. I gained a lot of experience and had a ton of fun working on these games.
We used the Unity engine, so all of it is written in C#
