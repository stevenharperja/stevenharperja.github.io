    <p>
        Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet! 

        I am a software developer with a passion for data science and machine learning.
        I like to learn new things and think about solutions to abstract problems.

        <!-- - AI, especially RL. But I like all kinds of it. the way that abstract and not straightforward problems can be solved through a clever combination of linear algebra, statistics, and cleverly designed programs amazes me and makes my imagination go wild with thoughts about how to solve different problems and how to optimize machine learning techniques. It's been wonderful keeping up with the progress of ml techniques in this booming time period, and I want to do something to contribute, though its hard to because of how fast it all goes. I still like just keeping up though. 
        - making board/video games. I like to think about how players would strategize when given different tools to play a game. I am personally of the belief of "depth over complexity", meaning that players should have to, as well as have the opportunity to, make a lot of interesting choices, with as few mechanics as possible. I've played strategy games and video games for a lot of my life. Some of my favorite board games are Twilight Imperium, Patchwork, and The Crew. Some of my favorite video games are Splatoon, Super Smash Brothers, and Minecraft. I also played a lot of Civilization 5.
        - studying japanese. I've been studying on and off for the last like 7 years. I primarily study nowadays by talking with people online and reading manga in japanese. I've met people online from other countries as well, and it's always a treat meeting them. It's really broadened my worldview and made me appreciate the similarities between peoples all over the world, as well as their cultural differences.
        - In my free time, I also like to go hiking. I've hiked in the mountains a bit in the pacific northwest. and I want to do it more. 
        - and I like to read manga. My favorite manga is Girl's Last Tour. -->
